# Functional data analysis normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models of severe acute mucositis and dysphagia

Functional data analysis models of severe acute mucositis and dysphagia resulting from head and neck radiotherapy.

To run the model use the PredictNtcpFDA.R R script. Values for the clinical covariates should be entered into the clinicalData.csv file.

The following dependencies should be installed:

- R
- The fda.usc R package

Details on the model training and validation can be found in the article:

Functional data analysis applied to modeling of severe acute mucositis and dysphagia resulting from head and neck radiation therapy. Dean  JA et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2016.

Please consider citing the above article in publications using the model.

These models are strictly for research purposes only. They should not be used for any clinical purposes.

If you encounter any problems trying to use the models or wish to discuss any aspects of them please feel free to contact me at jamie.adam.dean@gmail.com.
